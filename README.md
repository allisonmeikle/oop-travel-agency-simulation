# OOP Travel Agency Simulation
This project is a travel agency simulation for COMP 250 (Introduction to Computer Science), McGill University, Winter 2023. It involved designing and implementing multiple classes from scratch, including airports, hotels, rooms, and reservations, as well as managing customer baskets and booking logic. The project demonstrates skills in object-oriented programming, class hierarchy design, abstraction with abstract classes, inheritance, and algorithmic problem-solving. All functionality was implemented without using built-in collections, emphasizing careful class design and encapsulation.
